What I want to achieve:
-Work on the North-West Road Encounter List
--create a new list for the North West roads
--create a function that generates the result
--integrate calling the result into primary.py

This things should be much easy now that I have a better idea
of how modules and packages work in Python. I can effectively
copy my other code and insert new data into it.

also 

-update neovim to 5.0
-install lualine and look for some other plugins to make life easier
